Root Helper Android Application
===============================

Android API: 8 

This is an old application I developed for Root Users. Most of the functionality
requires root permissions. Everything in the application does work and works well
but as you can see, it lacks on the front end. I just wanted to let you know that 
this application was created for me to learn the Android OS and I ended up using
it quite a lot since my phone was rooted.
